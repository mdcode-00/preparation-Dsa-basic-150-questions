////Q1- Solving the Prime Mystery in a Programming Contest

//In a programming contest, you get a question: determine whether a given number is prime. You remember a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To solve this, you decide to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This way, you can quickly find if any divisor exists and decide primality.



evenOdd = (num) => {
  // Validate input: number must be greater than 0
  if (num <= 0) {
    console.log("Please enter a positive number");
    return;
  }

  // Use modulo operator to check remainder
  const remainder = num % 2;

  // If remainder is 0, number is EVEN
  if (remainder === 0) {
    console.log("EVEN");
  } else {            /// else ODD
    console.log("ODD");
  }
};

evenOdd(4);
